What is the java language? 
###################################################################################
Java is general-purpose computer programming language. it is based on class-based and object-oriented concepts.
Java language is designed for developers with the principle “write once, run anywhere” ,  it is mean that 
java is running on all platforms like that Windows, Macintosh, or UNIX machine that supported it is no need for recompilation. therefore Java is popular programming 
language.

Dont worry, If you are familiar with C++, learning Java will be particularly easy for you.
There are no pointers in Java language, nor is there pointer arithmetic. Strings and arrays are real
objects in Java language. Memory management is automatic. To an experienced developers, 
these omissions may be difficult to get used to, but to beginners or developers 
who have worked in other languages, they make the Java language far easier to learn.

In order to develop an application with Java language, you will, of course, need a Java development environment.
Java Development Kit (JDK) provides everything you need to start writing Java programs.

What About History of Java World?
###################################################################################
Java is developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. First released  is published in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems’ Java platform.
Nowsadays big company Oracle is the current owner of the Java SE platform, be possessed of Sun Microsystems on January 27, 2010.

Java Garbage Collector Mechanisms
###################################################################################
if you have unused things, you collect sometimes  these things, you junk these things, same as this programming language is working like that.
Java garbage collector is automatic  collector. it is not developer responsible. You can trust to Java language. 
Java garbage collector is active if unused objects in memory reaches critical level. 


###################################################################################
What is the JDK, JRE and JVM 
###################################################################################
Lets learn Step by Step launch java application; 

1) Create a file name of Hello.java then write a simple a code using Eclipse, Netbeans or other IDE.
2) If you use a IDE, it is compiled automatically, otherwise you can compile with Java compiler (javac). 
3) After compile processing, it is genereted Hello.class file.
4) Hello.class consist of java byte code that is used by Java Virtual Machine (JVM). JVM converts .class files into native machine code.

That's why JVMs are platform dependent. That's why when you compile your java source code to java bytecode you can run it on every platform.

JDK is Java Development Kit to development an application. it has generic java packages.

The JVM is the Java platform component that execute programs.
The JRE is the on-disk part of Java that creates the JVM. 
The JDK allows developers to create Java programs that can be executed and run by the JVM and JRE.

Build Hello World Java Program 
###################################################################################
To launch an app with java, you must run main method in Java.

package com.techmetriq.intro;

/**
 * @author techmetriq
 *
 */
public class HelloWorld {
	
	/*
	 *  Initializing of this point. 
	 */
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		System.out.println("Hello, this is a first application using by Java language.");
	}
}


#Why init method is main method and why put name as main?

Java Main method is a static standard method and has pre registered on JVM. its name is similar to C or C++. I think that It is a name that comes 
from the C language.  Java main method must be start public, static and void keyword and it accepts an String[] as argument.

#When we call main method, what happens in JVM?

The main method is the entry point of the JVM when the class in launched. 
The JVM launchs the Java program by invoking the main method of the class identified in the command to start the program.

What is the Object Oriented Programming
###################################################################################

Object Oriented Programming is very popular programming concept. C language is based on consists of nested functions. But java language is different from C language.
Think our body. We can say it very good to understand of object-oriented programming. We have arms, eyes, head, legs  etc. these are parts of our body.

Every part of our body works within itself and also works in harmony with others. Like that Java Application works concept of our body. An Java Application
can be consist of java modules like our head or legs. 

Assume that our mouth is an object. There are lots of features like speaking, eating and drinking etc. These our mouth features 
are mouth class like simple java class. If we create a java class, we determines object features. This is relation of Object-Class Relation.

Basicly Object-Oriented Concepts:

Polymorphism
Inheritence
Encapsulation
Abstraction

Polymorphism
  Again think our mouth. Some people in world speak English, Russian, Turkish etc. We are speak but different languages.
